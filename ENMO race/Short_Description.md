# Additional info

We used the Axivity AX3 sensors with 100Hz and a range of +/- 8g to sample the data. The sensors were placed midway between the hip and knee on the lateral side of the knee (either side).

The original data (.cwa-files) was processed using OmGui software (). We used the "SVM"-Calculator with an interval of 5 seconds, no filtering and the option truncating all negative values to zero. The processed data was exported in .csv format.
